# OpenBSD-Device-Driver

<p>After numerous days of reading random OpenBSD kernel files, digging through countless dma related manpages that no one reads,
slowly corrupting my VM from the amount of times the kernel has crashed, and going bald from all my hair I've torn out, I 
managed to scramble together something that kinda works.</p>

<p>This was an absolute nightmare from start to finish. It's poorly documented, can't be run anymore because I
don't have access to the device (nor do I have a copy of the device specifications), and even when it could run it was 
buggy at best. Yet I still felt like putting it up here, because it's the single most challenging program I've attempted to write and 
also the most I've learned writing a single program.</p>
